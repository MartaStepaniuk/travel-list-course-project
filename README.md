# Travel List Project

Project developed as part of the course ["The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) together with instructor [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).

Doing this project, I learned what useState is and how to work with it. I also learned what state management is, deciding when to create pieces of state, what types of state are needed, where to place each piece of state, and how data flows through the application.
